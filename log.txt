    - Forked repository, explored using visual studio code, github & github desktop. 
    - installed dependeicies, checked starting application was running.
    - What kind of applicaiton is this? Node?
        - checked node_modules for unfamilar packages
            - acorn - javascript parser 
            https://www.npmjs.com/package/acorn
            - acorn-globals
            https://www.npmjs.com/package/acorn-globals
            - expreee = server?
    - curl test from readme works
    
    Initial questions/thoughts
     - Wish there had been more stuff on api's in school, yikes.
     - 1M requests/minute... that is a lot, but I guess with a growing company and people using the device
       all over the world maybe 1M/minute is a low estimate.
     - Am I dealing with the client or the server with this sample api?
        - Seems like the client, possible things to look into:
            * asyinc, threading, load balancing (is that a server or client thing? both?)
                # Do I need to wait for a result to return before sending the next?
                # Would I have the application wait because it can only handle so many at a time
                # How to handle the overflow, where do requests go when waiting in line to be sent?
     - What is the current capacity?
     - What happens in a failure?
     - What would we want to happen in a failure?
     - How do I create a failure to test for failure cases?
     - What tools can I use to create that many requests?
     - How do I generate 1M requests!?

    Google search 'node api load testing'
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/loadtest

    Seems like a good way to blast it with a lot of requests at once.
